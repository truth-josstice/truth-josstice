## *"Truth & Josstice"* 
What's that all about? Well, it's my usual online handle,so it's me! It's also a little bit about me!

😸 My name is **Joss**, pronouns are **he/him**, and I'm just getting started on the git journey! I'm constantly curious and looking to learn, so I'm looking to uncover all of the hidden truths about coding! 

🧑‍💻 I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development in a BootCamp style course. We have so far worked on:
- HTML
- CSS
- Markdown
- Wireframing
- Git & Ubuntu

🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Since I'm just at the start of the journey, I'm familiar with the bare bones of HTML and CSS. 

We will also cover a whole bunch of other subjects:

🦇 A fun fact about me? I'm a pop culture trivia buff, so ask me about anything pop culture related and I'll (hopefully) know the answer! Otherwise it will just give me yet another thing to watch!
