# *"Truth & Josstice"*

What's that all about? Well, it's my usual online handle, so it's me! It's also a little bit about me!

I live by a sense of personal and community justice, and always filter my actions through a harm-reduction mindset. The ethics of web-development are of key focus for me, as well as honest, open, and supportive collaboration. 

üò∏ My name is **Joss**, pronouns are **he/him**! I'm constantly curious and looking to learn, so I'm looking to uncover all of the hidden truths about coding! I have always been most capable when I have to learn on the go, getting thrown in the deep end has always lead to really positive outcomes for me. So coding? That's a deep deep deep end! I am excited to learn not only what we study, but other languages and platforms.

üßë‚Äçüíª I'm currently completing a Full Stack Web Development Diploma in a BootCamp style course, which will finish up in February 2026! A list of my key skills? Sure have at it!

ü¶á A fun fact about me? I'm a pop culture trivia buff, so ask me about anything pop culture related and I'll (hopefully) know the answer! Otherwise it will just give me yet another thing to watch! I'm also a keen boulderer, so I'm familiar with learning through failure, being kind to myself, and most of all, the slow progress of learning a nonintuitive skill!
